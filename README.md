# Cashflow-An app designed to help you

The purpose of cash flow is to make it easy for its user to make a broad range of comparisons between their current credit cards and other potential credit cards (such as the one offered by costco), and notify them if their card is better for them, or if the other card is.

# Running the application

To run this application, you first need to clone the repository. Then, navigate
to the directory where it was cloned and open it in a terminal.

Then either of the following commands should work:
```
flask run
```

If the above command does not work, the following command can also be used (on
Linux):

```
export FLASK_APP = cashflow
flask run
```

# Verifying the features

## Home page

The functionality of this feature can be verified by launching the application.
Each page on the website should be able to connect to the home page through the
NAV bar.

## NAV Bar

This feature exists on every single page. It automatically adjusts itself
depending on the page that the user is on, and it also adjusts itself if the user
is logged in or not. If the user is logged on, they'll only have the ability to
logout. If the user is not logged in, they'll be able to login or register.

## Login

This feature can be tested by clicking on the "login" button on the NAV bar
or by pressing the "get started" button on the home page to view this page.
This page enables users to log in, and once logged in, they should be taken to
the input page where they can put their credit card name, and the information
associated with it. There is also a link on the login page that routes users to
the register page if they don't have an account.

## Register

Similar to the Login feauture, this feature can be tested by clicking on the
"register" button on the NAV bar. If a user doesn't input data into one of the
fields or if they don't type in a correctly formatted email, it should prompt
them to try again. After they sign up, they should be redirected to the login
page, where they can sign in with their new username/password.

## Logout

This feature appears on the NAV bar after a user logs in. By logging in, the
user should have the ability to logout, and they will be redirected to the home
page.

## Input Page

The user is redirected here after they login. On this page they can input basic
information about their credit card, such as the amount of money they spend on
three overall categories, and how much cash back (percentage) they receive from
this. After they press the submit button, the user will be redirected to the
final output page.

## Output Page

Currently, this page outputs the users credit cards. Here they can view their
current cards, and eventually they'll be able to remove and add a credit card.
This is so the user can manage the total amount of cards that they have, and the
ones that will be run through the comparison.

## CSS

This feature can be visible on a variety of degrees based on the page that the
user is on. Currently the CSS is complete for the Home, Login, and Registration
Page. Eventually, CSS will be applied to all of the web pages.
